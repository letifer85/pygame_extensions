PyGame Extensions

![Tests](https://github.com/letifer85/pygame_extensions/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)


WIP and a messy repo with the goal to add simple extension classes to `pygame`.
Currently there is only `AnimatedSprite` extension witch is "usable".
Made it for my own use but I'm thinking on expanding on it.
